> 内容描述

```
Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the mode(s) (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 

For example:
Given BST [1,null,2,2],

   1
    \
     2
    /
   2
 

return [2].

Note: If a tree has more than one mode, you can return them in any order.

Follow up: Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).

求出所有node的集合，然后求众数即可

beats 90.44%

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findMode(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        if not root:
            return []
        res, cur_level = [], [root]
        while cur_level:
            next_level, tmp_res = [], []
            for node in cur_level:
                tmp_res.append(node.val)
                if node.left:
                    next_level.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    next_level.append(node.right)
            res.extend(tmp_res)
            cur_level = next_level
        c = collections.Counter(res)
        max_freq = max(c.values())
        res = []
        for key in c:
            if c[key] == max_freq:
                res.append(key)
        return res
```
