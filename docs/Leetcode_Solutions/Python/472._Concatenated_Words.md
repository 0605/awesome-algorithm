> 内容描述

```
Given a list of words (without duplicates), please write a program that returns all concatenated words in the given list of words.
A concatenated word is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at least two shorter words in the given array.

Example:
Input: ["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"]

Output: ["catsdogcats","dogcatsdog","ratcatdogcat"]

Explanation: "catsdogcats" can be concatenated by "cats", "dog" and "cats"; 
 "dogcatsdog" can be concatenated by "dog", "cats" and "dog"; 
"ratcatdogcat" can be concatenated by "rat", "cat", "dog" and "cat".
Note:
The number of elements of the given array will not exceed 10,000
The length sum of elements in the given array will not exceed 600,000.
All the input string will only include lower case letters.
The returned elements order does not matter.

Trie 树，参考[GraceMeng](https://leetcode.com/problems/concatenated-words/discuss/176805/52ms-Prefix-Tree-(Trie)-and-Backtracking-Java-with-Explanation)

```
A concatenated word is a word that satisfies:
  - exist in words;
  - is combination of at least 2 words in words;

In other words, a concatenated word is a word add other word(words) as prefix. 
That's natual to prefix tree(trie). 
We can build a trie using words and search for concatenated words in the trie. 

We have to make a decision when we meet a node that meets the end of a word (with en in the example below). We can
  - either take the current node's associated word as prefix (and restart at root for another word) 
  - or not take the  current node's associated word as prefix (i.e. move further within the same branch).

```python
class TrieNode(object):
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = dict()
        self.isWordEnd = False
        
        
class Solution:
    def findAllConcatenatedWordsInADict(self, words):
        """
        :type words: List[str]
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        if not words or len(words) == 0:
            return []
        res = []
        self.root = TrieNode()
        self.buildTrie(words)
        for word in words:
            if self.isConcatenation(0, word, 0):
                res.append(word)
        return res
    
    def isConcatenation(self, idx, word, count): # idx代表当前正在比较word的第几个char
        ptr = self.root
        for i in range(idx, len(word)):
            if word[i] not in ptr.children: # 如果当前word不存在，肯定不行
                return False
            ptr = ptr.children[word[i]]
            if ptr.isWordEnd:
                if i == len(word) - 1: # 如果比较到了word的最后一个字符，那么看看是否是由2个以上的word组成的
                    return count >= 1
                if self.isConcatenation(i+1, word, count+1): # 递归判断
                    return True
        return False
    
    def buildTrie(self, words):
        ptr = TrieNode()
        for word in words:
            ptr = self.root
            for c in word:
                if c not in ptr.children:
                    ptr.children[c] = TrieNode()
                ptr = ptr.children[c]
            ptr.isWordEnd = True
